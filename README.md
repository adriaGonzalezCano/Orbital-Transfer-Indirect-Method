# Orbital-Transfer-Indirect-Method
This repository is part of the project "Optimal Orbital Transfers: A Study of
Indirect Methods" developed in 2024 at ISAE-SUPAERO by Adrià González Cano.
It includes the following files:

- RP Indirect Method - main: Main optimal transfer problem using planar polar coordinates. It includes the transfer data of a validation problem, an Earth-to-Mars transfer, and a low-thrust problem.
- RP Indirect Method - main - 3D: Optimal transfer problem using spherical coordinates. It includes the data of a validation Earth-to-Mars problem.
